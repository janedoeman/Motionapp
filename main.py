TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Defendant {defendant_info.name}, through undersigned counsel, respectfully moves this Court for compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) and the First Step Act of 2018.

Based on recent precedents from the U.S. Sentencing Commission and federal courts, including data from FY 2024 quarterly reports showing increased success rates for motions with compelling medical circumstances, this motion presents extraordinary and compelling reasons warranting immediate release.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE

I. INTRODUCTION

Defendant {defendant_info.name} seeks compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), as amended by the First Step Act. Recent U.S. Sentencing Commission data shows courts in {defendant_info.district} have recognized the evolving standards for extraordinary and compelling circumstances.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

The First Step Act of 2018 amended 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) to allow defendants to petition directly for compassionate release after exhausting administrative remedies or waiting 30 days. Per the U.S. Sentencing Commission's 2024 quarterly reports, courts must consider: (1) extraordinary and compelling circumstances; (2) the § 3553(a) factors; and (3) public safety implications.

III. ARGUMENT

A. Extraordinary and Compelling Circumstances Exist

Based on current legal precedents and the research conducted, federal courts have increasingly recognized that medical conditions combined with family circumstances constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons for release. The Fifth Circuit's recent guidance emphasizes that district courts retain discretion in evaluating such circumstances.

B. Section 3553(a) Factors Support Release

The sentencing factors support compassionate release, particularly given defendant's rehabilitation efforts and changed circumstances since sentencing.

C. Public Safety is Not Compromised

Defendant poses no danger to the community, as evidenced by the release plan and family support structure.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, incorporating current legal authorities and precedents found through comprehensive research, this Court should grant {defendant_info.name}'s motion for compassionate release.

Respectfully submitted,
[Attorney Name]

3. I have experienced significant medical conditions that constitute extraordinary and compelling circumstances warranting compassionate release under current federal guidelines.

4. I have strong family and community support for my release, including verified housing arrangements and medical care plans.

5. I have participated extensively in rehabilitative programming during my incarceration and pose no danger to the community upon release.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
