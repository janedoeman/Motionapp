- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (diagnosed 2019)

- Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 (diagnosed 2023)

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
- Metformin 1000mg twice daily
- Lisinopril 10mg daily
- Insulin glargine 25 units at bedtime

RECENT LABORATORY RESULTS:
- HbA1c: 8.2% (elevated, poor glycemic control)
- eGFR: 45 mL/min/1.73mÂ² (stage 3 CKD)
- Blood pressure: consistently 150/95 despite medication

TREATMENT CHALLENGES:
The institutional environment presents significant challenges for optimal diabetes management. Limited access to fresh foods, irregular meal timing due to institutional schedules, and stress-related factors have contributed to poor glycemic control. The patient would benefit from closer monitoring and dietary modifications that are difficult to achieve in the current setting.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Continued medical management with potential for improved outcomes in a community setting with access to endocrinology specialty care, diabetes education, and appropriate dietary resources."""
